# Cleaning data - Peer graded assignment

The file run_analysis.R has the commented workflow to parse accelerometer data into a tidy dataset.

The file does the following:
- Download and extract Samsung accelerometer data
- Read activity types and measurements for training and test sets
- Combine the data into a unified set
- Label data
- Melt data into tidy dataset
- And finally calculate average value for each feature/activity type

More details about the process commented in run_analysis.R
